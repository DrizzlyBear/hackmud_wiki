import PlayerScript from "../../../components/PlayerScript.astro"

<PlayerScript name="echo.echo"/> is a player script who's implementation looks something like the following:
```js
function (context, args) {
	return args.echo
}
```

It is used for demonstration purposes but you can upload this script yourself and replace every instance of
<PlayerScript name="echo.echo"/> in this wiki with the name of your own script when testing the demos.
